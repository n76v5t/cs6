INF 1341 ? Systems Analysis and Process Innovation
Assignment 1: Initial exploration of a study site
Due Date: Friday, Sept. 20, 11:59 pm
This assignment counts for 20% of the course grade.
(Individual work)
In this course, you will carry out a series of assignments to apply systems analysis techniques to
real world settings. As a preliminary step, in this Assignment 1, you will identify a suitable
organization as your primary study site. Your work in Assignment 2 will be based primarily on
information you collect about this site, and possibly prior knowledge you have about similar
organizational settings, as well as published literature.
In subsequent assignments, as you join others in a team, your primary site will be viewed as part of
a larger setting, which will allow your team to study interactions among information systems across
organizations. Thus, in selecting your primary site, you are also selecting the industry/business/
economic sector that it is associated with, e.g., healthcare, retail, financial services, etc.
I. Doing the Assignment
Find an organizational setting in which you expect information systems to have potential impact,
allowing you to explore opportunities for process automation, innovation, and fundamental
transformation. The organization can be one that you are already familiar with, for example, your
current or former place of work. You may also explore prospective sites through friends,
acquaintances, relatives, etc.

Typically, you will be looking for a work setting in which a number of people working in different
capacities produce some joint output or result, i.e., a “business process” or work process. This can
be a department or section in a large organization (e.g., customer relations) or a work process that
cuts across several departments (e.g., contract proposals in an engineering firm). The organization
can be a business corporation, or non-profit such as a hospital, a school, a university, a government
agency, etc. It can also be a small business (e.g., a retail store, a professional office, etc.) Volunteer
and community organizations often also have information systems needs, e.g., professional
associations, community centres, student organizations, clubs, etc. Each student should select a
different site – different organizations, or different parts within a larger organization.

The site should be able to provide you with the information you need to carry out your systems
analysis. Ideally, you should have contact(s) in the organization who you can interview. For
example, you will want to know what the perceived problems are in their current operations, and
what areas they believe offer opportunities for improvement. You will want to know their
organizational objectives, criteria or measures of success, and the basic ins and outs of their
operations. In this course, the emphasis will be on the early stage of systems analysis. You will not
be expected to produce a complete system specification.

The work process should contain some recurring tasks that are amenable to information systems
support, e.g., storing data in databases according to some data model, performing updates, queries,
calculations on the data, etc. As part of this initial exploration, you are required to develop a BPMN

t

model of the selected work process. It should show the main activities carried out by the
participants and their interactions. It should be at a level of detail where some issues and concerns
about the process can be revealed.

The site may contain some operations that are already computerized, and others that are not.
Consider sites that will potentially benefit from new technologies (e.g., use of mobile devices,
sensors), or business model change (e.g., disintermediation). Consider competitive or regulatory
pressures (e.g., legal compliance, environmental initiatives). Try to select a site of reasonable scope
– small enough to be manageable for an assignment, but large enough to exercise and demonstrate
the techniques you learn in the course. If you feel the need to adjust the scope of your site after you
have started, you may do so in consultation with the instructor.

In approaching an organization, you should talk to someone who has the authority to decide to assist
you. You may need to camouflage or alter some details to prevent disclosure of sensitive
information. This is fine as long as the objectives of the course can still be achieved. To facilitate
your subsequent assignments, it will be desirable to have access to someone in the organization who
can discuss possible changes in operations, and future directions for the sector. Your engagement
with the site organization should be mutually beneficial. You should outline the intent of your
project, what it involves, and also clarify mutual expectations. It may be helpful to provide a letter
to the prospective participant describing the nature of your project and mutual expectations. A draft
of such a letter is attached.
Project guidelines
You are required to obtain verbal consent from the participant, and to identify the following
information to participants:
? that you are a University of Toronto graduate student
? the Department and Program that you are enrolled in;
? relationship (if any) of the student(s) to the organization/participant, e.g. employee, employees
of competitor or partner organizations;
? purpose of interview or visit e.g. description of assignment/project;
? length of interview;
? how information will be used e.g., paper and/or oral presentation;
? confidentiality and anonymity re key informants e.g., no informant will be identified by name,
position or area of responsibility unless they have expressly given permission to do so.

Your immediate contact may need to seek permission from higher authorities in the organization before
agreeing to participate. Allow time for this in your schedule.
Interviews with clients of the participant’s organization or with patients are not permitted.
The data collected for your project is not expected to be confidential. You are advised to avoid
projects that involve confidential information, such as trade secrets or proprietary work processes.
You will not collect personal information about participants. To minimize participant concerns, the
sources of raw data (e.g., interviewees) should be anonymized (replaced with fictitious names), or
the raw data will not be attributed to any source. The name of organization will also be anonymized.
In cases where the informant considers neither anonymity nor non-attribution to be providing
sufficient protection (e.g., when an employee has inadvertently disclosed information that he/she
Page 3 of 7




does not want his/her coworkers or management to know about), such information will be excluded
from in-class discussions and written reports.
Since you are expected to discuss assignment findings in class, it is best to avoid study sites that
require you to sign a non-disclosure agreement. If this is unavoidable, you should obtain written
permission that the information disclosed to you can be used in a course project that will be
discussed in class.

When a participant discloses information under condition of confidentiality, such conditions must
be fully respected (e.g., disclosure to the participant’s colleagues or management may have adverse
consequences for the participant.)

The participants should be informed, verbally or in writing, of their right to withdraw from the study
at any time. The participant’s data will be destroyed at the participant’s request upon their
withdrawal from the study.

All copies of the students’ reports—e.g., for circulation as courtesy copies, or future writing
samples—must clearly indicate on the cover page the instructor, course number, and department or
program at the University of Toronto that the report was prepared for.

II. What to Hand In
Each student is to submit a 3-page document outlining the proposed study site (including 1 page for
the BPMN model). The document should include, in this order, the following items.
1. Keywords short phrases identifying…
Name of organization: e.g., Prince George Hospital
Nature of business: e.g., cancer care hospital
Sector (one or more keywords): e.g., healthcare services
Business process description: e.g., patient discharge
2. The organization A paragraph providing general background, e.g., size, location, current
issues.
3. The business process This is the part of the organization you have chosen to focus on.
Provide a short description of what it entails – activity steps, who does what, issues and
concerns, policies and procedures, resources and constraints.
4. BPMN model of the business/work process.
5. Suitability Why this organization is a good choice. Some initial ideas about opportunities for
(i) automation, (ii) innovation, and (iii) transformation. You are not confined to these in your
subsequent assignments. Examples:
i Automation: maintain a database of patient discharge information to reduce paper work and
avoid duplication and errors.
ii Innovation: allow doctors, nurses, and social workers to update patient discharge information
directly so that delays can be avoided. Mobile Internet access via smart phones or tablets can be
used.
iii Transformation: earlier discharge ca代 写INF 1341 ? Systems Analysis and Process Innovati

instruments, and online help for family members or home care personnel.
6. Accessibility An indication of the contacts and the nature of access you have to the
organizational setting. (Names not required, positions/roles useful.)

1341-A1-yourlastname-firstname. PDF file format is preferred; MS Word is acceptable.
? Hardcopy: not required.
? You must also provide an index entry for your submitted assignment on a designated online file,
location to be announced.

Formatting Requirements
Use letter size (8.5 x 11 inch) paper format. The preferred text format is 11-point font size, single
spaced. The header should have the course number and assignment number on the left, your name
in the middle, and the date on the right. Do not include a cover sheet with this Assignment.

Grading Criteria
Document (10% of grade)
? Language should be clear and understandable. Uses logical statements and structuring of
arguments. Proofread carefully before submitting. Correct spelling and grammatical errors.
? Document should be formatted properly and consistently (headers present, sectional headings
present, page margins, justifications, indentations, consistency)
? BPMN model is legible and sized appropriately.
? 3-page document limit is recommended. Going over is okay if there was no unjustifiable need
(unnecessarily details, excessive narration, incorrect indentation or margins, large font size
etc.)
? Assignment named correctly as per requirements. There should be only one file uploaded
(containing text + diagram). The document is in PDF format. Visio or Lucidchart files are not
accepted.
Organization Under Study (10% of grade)
? Describe the organization in terms of size, location, and other quantitative measures.
? What are the organizational goals and objectives?
? What are the major organizational issues, problems and challenges?
Business Process (25% of grade)
? Briefly describe the business process being considered. What is its objective?
? Why is this business process important and considered and not others? What is its criticality
(i.e., is it a core business process)? Core business processes lead to more meaningful analysis.
? What are the main activity steps? Note: The expectation is not to restate the BPMN diagram
but to complement that model.
? Any main information systems? Online or offline processes? Manual passing of information /
data? Note: Should not be a technology-centric explanation analysis but rather from a business
impact viewpoint.
? What are the main issues with the business process? Note: The issues should pertain to the
business process itself rather than organization or operational issues. Note2: Do not wait to get
to the solution section before describing the problem.
? Is the size and scale of the business process appropriate for meaningful analysis. The business
process should not be too small or too large (i.e. many business processes being treated as
one).

BPMN Model Diagram (25% of grade)
? Is the BPMN model logically structured, including logical start and end events?
? Appropriately demonstrates the use of a range of modeling concepts and constructs.
? Does it capture the activities of the relevant organizational roles and/or systems? Are the
sequences correct and complete?
? Does the BPMN model diagram stand on its own without having to rely on the text for
understanding? Note: This means that the BPMN diagram should not be confusing and
erroneous.
Suitability (30% of grade)
? Clearly indicate what are the automation, innovation and transformations being proposed.
? All three should relate to the business process under study and show a progression of analysis
and scope.
? Problems should not be mentioned for the first time while a solution idea is being put forward.
Problems should be detailed in the previous section with the solutions coming later.
? The three solutions should indicate the business impact that they are expected to have,
particularly with respect to the business and process issues stated previously.
? A solution should not be stated in terms of a mere mention of a technology. Say why it will be
useful and what aspect of the problem will be addressed. For example: “By implementing
technology X…. we get these benefits … will solve this ….”



Template Letter to Prospective Project Participants


(( date ))

Dear Project Participant,

I am a graduate student enrolled in a course entitled “Systems Analysis and Process Innovation” at
the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. The purpose of the course is to equip students
with the conceptual foundations and skills needed to analyze business processes in an organization
in order to explore opportunities for innovations and improvements, eventually leading to
requirements definition for information systems. Too often, computer systems are introduced into
an organization without an adequate understanding of the business and organizational environment,
resulting in systems that are ineffective or even counter-productive. This course emphasizes the
need to understand the organizational setting, analyze problems and needs, and to explore options
before proceeding to seek technology solutions.

A major component of the course is a project in which we apply the concepts and techniques we
learn in class to real-life work settings. Each student will study and analyze work processes and
information systems requirements for some portion of an organization. Later in the course, students
will work in small groups (typically three to four persons) to explore further innovation or
transformational opportunities for selected organizational settings. I am therefore looking for people
who are willing to cooperate by letting me (and possibly later my teammates) study and understand
how work is currently done, with a view towards exploring potential innovations using information
technologies and systems. The current work setting may of course already include various forms of
technologies and systems at various levels of sophistication. Overall this will mean a couple of
hours of someone's time talking with me, and possibly meeting together with my teammates later
once or twice. We will be careful not to impose beyond our welcome.
WHAT WE WILL DO
Mainly I will ask questions, take notes, and if circumstances permit, observe how things get done.
With permission, I may like to make audio recordings so I can check for things I forgot to write
down. If there are relevant documents that can facilitate our understanding of the work setting, we
would appreciate the opportunity to peruse them.
Our aim is to understand work objectives, workflows, processes, procedures, policies, and various
data and information relevant to the work. We will depict our understanding in diagrammatic
models to assist our analysis, and to use them to explore options.
WHAT YOU WILL GET
Hopefully, the time that you spend with me and my teammates will be enjoyable and perhaps
enlightening for you as well. We are well-motivated and eager to learn. We promise to share with
you any insights and materials we develop (including the written documentation that we will be
handing in with the project). We will attempt to do our best in the study. If, however, you feel that
the results of our study can be the starting point for making some changes in your organization, that
will be a bonus for everyone.




CONSIDERATIONS
You can expect us to act in a responsible and professional manner. This includes respecting any
conditions you or your managers set on the confidentiality of the materials we work with. However,
we want to avoid any projects that may involve material that is legally or institutionally restricted
(such as medical records, trade secrets, student grades and recommendations, etc.) since we do not
want to have to set up the formal agreements for ensuring accountability for these types of
information. Confidential information will not be used in our discussions or in written reports. In
the event that confidential information is recorded, such information will be kept in a secure
location and destroyed as soon as possible. We will replace the names of individuals and of your
organization with fictitious names. Once we have started, we will like to be able to continue through
the end of the project. However, according to research ethics protocols, participants have the right
to withdraw from the study at any time. If you have any concerns about the conduct of our research
team, please feel free to contact the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board at: Office of
Research Ethics, McMurrich Building, 12 Queens's Park Crescent West, Toronto ON M5S 1S8,
Tel: 416-978-2798, Fax: 416-946-5763, email: ethics.review@utoronto.ca.

I am very excited about this project. It is so much more interesting (and fun!) to work on
assignments that are rooted in real-life. I hope that this project will be a productive and rewarding
experience for everyone involved. If you have any questions about this project, please do not
hesitate to call me (email: ……….. phone: ............. ). Thanks in advance for your participation.

Sincerely,
